	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// mountCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	//mountCmd.Flags().IntP("cpus", "c", 1, "Number of cpu cores")
	//mountCmd.Flags().IntP("mem", "m", 1024, "Memory size in mega bytes")
